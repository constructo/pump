Pump is a programming language borrowing ideas from dataflow, flow-based and reactive programming. Its thus an experiment of totally forsaking imperative and sequential execution of programs.

The first step is to make java prototype of a  virtual machine that operates on directed graphs (as opposed to stack and sequence of instructions) and then build the Pump language upon it.
